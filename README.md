### Hi there my name is Mason Clarke 👋
My passion for software development
started when I realized that I could
take what most would call
“unreadable words” and use them to
bring ideas to life on any screen for
the user. I first started my journey
with computer science back in
highschool when I used an MIT app
creator that allowed us to code online
using building blocks. From there I
quickly fell in love with using programming to
create a functional and easy to use
product for users. I am very excited to
keep enhancing my skills so that I can
express my passion and show my
knowledge to the world by bringing
ideas to life.
