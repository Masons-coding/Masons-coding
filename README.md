### Hi there my name is Mason Clarke ðŸ‘‹
My passion for software development began when I discovered the power of transforming what many might see as "unreadable code" into dynamic, user-friendly applications that bring ideas to life on any screen. My journey into computer science started in high school, where I used MITâ€™s App Inventor to create programs online with a block-based coding interface. This experience sparked my fascination with building functional, intuitive products that provide real value to users. I am eager to continue honing my skills, channeling my passion, and showcasing my knowledge by creating innovative solutions that bring concepts to life.
